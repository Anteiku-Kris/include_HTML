# include_HTML

<p>This is a small practice of a library update in javascript that I am "using", inspired by the library created by Jonathan Mircha using the XMLHttpRequest method used in JavaScript, I have decided to create a more modern version using Fetch with asynchronous functions. 
> Simply include the include-html.min.js script in your <head> and add a data-include attribute on any valid HTML element </p>

<h1>How to use</h1>
include-html will fetch the value of that attribute, and replace the element with the fetched file.
